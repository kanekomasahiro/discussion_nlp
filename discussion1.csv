So that way, like, I was like, okay, I don't know, cause, um, they might not be the exact same thing. So I said neutral."

5,2,TRUE,Human1,"Yeah. I don't know. I just find it's like a contradiction, I think, cause like, if you're a young girl, you could be a parent, but a grandparent is like, far away, like for you to be like, let's say you had a kid when you're 10 and then your kid has a kid when they're 10, but they tell you to become a grandparent when you're like 20 years, at least 20 years old and above.

So like they're performing in front of people, but the premise says beautiful young dancer and like only one, but like the hypothesis is the young dancers. So that's the only thing that caused me to put neutral, but I'm not sure if that's just a typo."
6,2,TRUE,Human1,"Yeah. I looked up acrobatic and then it says that you can only perform acrobatics in like, it's a team sport, so you can't do it alone. So even though they didn't mention like the person's partner, because like it's a game of like two people and more, so there are dancers. That's like what made me choose like Intelment because I was like, okay, I also saw the dancers thing and they only mentioned the girl, then it looked up like, can you do acrobatics alone? And then like what I saw online is that it's a team sport, so you can't dance, do an acrobatic dance alone."

They had, they put on shoes, snowshoes, I was thinking like you can't be walking on like snow or ice without shoes. So before they jump, they had to decide that they're going to put on shoes and proceed with that. So that's what I thought."
7,3,TRUE,Human2,"Oh yeah. A snowshoes are actually something different. So they're not like normal shoes. They're like, they look like tennis rackets, but you strap the tennis rackets onto your feet. So they're, they're used for like a hiking in the snow, like in the snow. But yeah."
7,4,TRUE,Human1,Snowboarding is different.
